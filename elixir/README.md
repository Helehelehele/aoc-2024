# Advent of Code 2024 - Elixir

The days are split into directories. In order to run the solutions, you need to have Elixir installed on your machine, and then you can run the solutions with the following command:

```sh
iex -S mix # Start the Elixir REPL
```

Then you can run the solutions like this:

```elixir

Aoc.Day01.solve_part1("day01/input.txt")
Aoc.Day01.solve_part2("day01/input.txt")
# ...etc

```
